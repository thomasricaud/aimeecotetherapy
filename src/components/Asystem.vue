      <h1>How is a family like a system?</h1>

        Marriage and family therapy is known as "systemic therapy" in France.
        This is because marriage and family therapists, or MFT's, see families
        as systems of people and relationships. Like other types of systems,
        even mechanical ones, families try to maintain balance or equilibrium.
        When changes arise, the system quickly tries to re-balance itself. A
        common example of this is the thermostat in your home. The system is at
        equilibrium when it's at the set temperature on the thermostat. When the
        temperature drops , the heating system kicks on. When the thermostat
        senses the home has reached the right temperature, the heat shuts off.
        Equilibrium is back.

        We can apply this idea to a family confronting a problem. If one family
        member is struggling with depression, for example, other family members
        may alter their emotional state or behavior to get the family back into
        balance. Some ways are more conducive to mental health than others. For
        instance, in one family, people might reach out to the depressed
        individual to offer support. But in another family, members might
        respond by also becoming depressed as a way to share the burden. As you
        can imagine, this probably won't be effective at restoring harmony. When
        the family's response to a problem drives the system further out of
        balance, this is when therapy can be helpful.
