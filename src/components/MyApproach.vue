          <p>My degree is in systemic therapy. Systemic therapists, often called "Family Therapists" or "Marriage and Family Therapists," try to understand the client in the context of his or her family system or system of other close relationships. In family systems, we often take on roles that may limit our happiness and feeling of being loved and cared for. While systemic therapy is ideal for working with families and couples, it is also effective for individuals. After all, many problems we face as individuals have to do with our relationships.</p>

          <p>The models I favor tend to be very "client-centered." That means that I put you and your goals first, rather than imposing my ideas on you. In other words, I will make suggestions, but they must feel right to you, and ultimately, the choice is yours. I am here to guide you and your family, not to "fix" you, because you are not broken, even if it feels like it at times. You and your family members possess a wealth of resources and strengths that I will help you uncover. </p>
