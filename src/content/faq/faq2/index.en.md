question: "Can relationship counseling work if my partner won’t come?"
---
Yes. You don’t need both partners in the room to make progress. In fact, one person can create meaningful changes in a relationship by learning new ways of communicating, setting healthy boundaries, and gaining clarity about what they truly want.
